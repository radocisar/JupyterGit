    "An hospital specialised in skin-related diseases wants to **increase** the number of patients they can treat. They would like to know in a accurate and fast way, whether or not moles need to be removed surgically, in order to optimise the surgical procedures.\n",

    "- having an algorithm sorting out moles would increase the number of visited patients per day, by speeding up the monitoring procedures\n",
